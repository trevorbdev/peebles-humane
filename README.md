# PeeblesHumane

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.0.

Before downloading the project, make sure you have nodejs installed from https://nodejs.org/

After downloading the project, use the command line to go to the peebles-humane folder and run "npm install"

After running "npm install", run "ng serve" which will serve the app on http://localhost:4200/

To login to the admin dashboard, go to http://localhost:4200/login after running "ng serve"

Other than these steps, there should be no other steps to perform for proper running of the application, since the database is in the cloud, a npm package handles the connections
